# Lab 1: NDVI Analysis in Google Earth Engine

In this lab, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) is used to extract NDVI data, which a common reflectance based vegetation index from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Satellite Imaging System). The NDVI data is then processed and visualized using Google earth engine and java script, as well as the NDVI data. The resulting gif shows the vegetation cover changes across the boundary of India over the past two decades based on the Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). In the existing gif, NDVI is mapped to a color gradient from tan to dark green representing low to high photosynthetic capacity (low to high vegetation cover/density/productivity). We can see that the northern and the western part of India (towards laddakh and Rajasthan) the photosynthetic capacity remained low while the capacity increased on average for the overall country starting from the north eastern end of the boundary reaching far south which implies that there is an increase in the vegetation index of the country over the past decades.
